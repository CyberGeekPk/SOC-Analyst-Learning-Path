# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
## What is EDR?
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a security product that is installed on endpoint-qualified devices, constantly monitors the activities in the system, tries to detect security threats such as ransomware & malware, and takes action against malicious activities.

## EDR Core Components
EDR products can perform many different operations on the endpoint device. These are the processes that support each other to ensure the security of the device. EDR core components are as follows:

- Endpoint data collection agents
- Automated response
- Analysis and forensics

## Functions of EDR
The duties of EDR products are generally as follows:

- Monitoring and collecting each process on the device that may identify a security threat
- Analyzing the behavior of threat actors according to the data collected on the device
- Informing the relevant analyst by taking the appropriate security action against the threat actor obtained from the collected data.
- Allow forensic analysis on the device to conduct in-depth investigation of suspicious activities

## The Importance of EDR for Security
Ensuring the security of the devices that EDR products need to protect has become an essential element to be considered today. Because attackers aim to gain access to the network by turning to weak devices in terms of security. After gaining access to the network through an endpoint, the attacker tries to access more critical systems. In this way, if there is an endpoint that does not have an EDR product installed and is not sufficiently secure, it can be used by the attacker for initial access.

Some popular EDR products used within the cybersecurity industry are as follows:

- SentinelOne
- Crowdstrike
- CarbonBlack
- Palo Alto
- FireEye HX

## What log sources does EDR have?
EDR product keeps some information as a log by monitoring the system on which it is installed. The processes running on the system are monitored and the names of the files accessed by the programs and their access information are recorded by EDR as logs. It records which programs are run, which files the run programs read, or which file they make changes to. Each EDR can obtain various information through the system. In general, it can be said that the EDR product monitors and logs the sections deemed necessary in terms of security.
