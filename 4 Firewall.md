# Firewall
## What is Firewall?
A firewall is a security software or hardware that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic according to the rules it contains and allows the passage of network packets or prevents the passage of packets according to the nature of the rule.

## Types of Firewall
A firewall is divided into many different types according to its features:
Application-Level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls)
Application-Level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls) are a type of firewall that functions at the application layer between two end systems. Unlike basic firewalls, it captures and analyzes packets in the application layer according to the OSI model. In this way, it works as an additional security measure on the application layer.

- ### Circuit-Level Gateways
Circuit-Level Gateways are a type of firewall that can be easily configured, has low resource consumption, and has a simplified structure. These types of firewalls verify TCP connections and sessions and operate in the session layer of the OSI model.

- ### Cloud Firewalls
Cloud Firewalls are the type of firewall used when the institution receives firewall service over the cloud as a service. Another name is "FWaaS" (firewall-as-a-service). There are some advantages to using a cloud firewall. For example, cloud firewalls have no physical resources, so they can be easily reconfigured based on demand or traffic load. Additional capacity can be added to accommodate increased traffic.

- ### Endpoint Firewalls
Endpoint Firewalls are a type of host-based firewall installed on devices. It is a type of firewall that is often difficult to manage. It is an important component that must be used to ensure security. For example, the "Windows Defender Firewall", which comes pre-installed in Windows, is an example of this type of firewall.

- ### Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls
Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls are a type of firewall designed to access internet traffic and block unwanted connections. Such firewalls are used to hide the IP addresses in the internal network from the external network. In other words, it is the firewall where NAT is applied.
