# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## What is IDS?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is hardware or software used to detect security breaches and attacks by monitoring a network or host.

## Types of IDS

There are many different types of IDS products:

### Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is used to detect whether there is traffic suitable for attacker behavior by passing all traffic on the network through it. When abnormal behavior is observed in the traffic, an alert can be generated and the administrator can be informed.

### Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)
The Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) works on a specific host in the network. It tries to detect malicious activities by examining all network packets coming to this device and all network packets going from this device. Detected malicious behaviors are reported to the administrator as an alert.

### Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS)
A protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) is a type of IDS that examines the traffic between a server and a client in a protocol-specific way.

### Application Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS)
An Application Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS) is a type of IDS that tries to detect security breaches by monitoring communication in application-specific protocols.

### Hybrid Intrusion Detection System
A hybrid Intrusion Detection System is a type of IDS in which two or more violation detection approaches are used together.
